{ORANGE} == {YELLOW}dotui{ORANGE} == {WHITE}

{YELLOW}dotui{WHITE} (stylized {YELLOW}.UI{WHITE}) is the first iteration of {YELLOW}.OS{WHITE}'s graphical user interface stack.  Its user interface toolkit, while functional, requires a rather significant amount of boilerplate code and is rather inflexible.  {YELLOW}.WM{WHITE}, a better window manager, and {YELLOW}.TK{WHITE}, a replacement GUI toolkit, are intended to solve both of these problems in a reasonably sane manner.

To change the system interface to {YELLOW}.ui{WHITE}, run {BLUE}set interface dotui{WHITE} in the shell and reboot.
