{ORANGE}--{YELLOW} Weird Syntax {ORANGE}--{WHITE}
{YELLOW}.SH{WHITE}'s special syntax is based around balanced sets of curly braces ({RED}{}{WHITE}).  If inside these is a valid argument, then its corresponding action will be performed and it will be replaced with the result.

The following special keywords may be present:
  {ORANGE}-{RED} RED{WHITE}     insert a vt100 escape for red color
  {ORANGE}-{RED} WHITE{WHITE}   insert a vt100 escape for white color
  {ORANGE}-{RED} BLUE{WHITE}    insert a vt100 escape for blue color
  {ORANGE}-{RED} YELLOW{WHITE}  insert a vt100 escape for yellow color
  {ORANGE}-{RED} ORANGE{WHITE}  insert a vt100 escape for orange color
  {ORANGE}-{RED} GREEN{WHITE}   insert a vt100 escape for green color

The following special syntax is accepted:
  {ORANGE}.{YELLOW}foo{WHITE}
    Execute command {YELLOW}foo{WHITE} and substitute its output.  Equivalent to Bash's {RED}$(foo){WHITE}

  {ORANGE}.>{GREEN}file {YELLOW}foo{WHITE}
    Execute command {YELLOW}foo{WHITE} and redirect its output into {GREEN}file{WHITE}.

  {ORANGE}.+{GREEN}file {YELLOW}foo{WHITE}
    Like {RED}.>{WHITE}, but also return the command's output like {RED}.{WHITE}.

  {ORANGE}${YELLOW}bar{WHITE}
    Get the value of the environment variable {YELLOW}bar{WHITE}.

  {ORANGE}$@{YELLOW}bar{ORANGE}={YELLOW}baz{WHITE}
    Set the environment variable {YELLOW}bar{WHITE} to {YELLOW}baz{WHITE}.

  {ORANGE}$+{YELLOW}bar{ORANGE}={YELLOW}baz{WHITE}
    Like {RED}$@{WHITE}, but also returns {YELLOW}baz{WHITE}.

  {ORANGE}$!{YELLOW}bar{WHITE}
    Unset the environment variable {YELLOW}bar{WHITE}.

  {ORANGE}$?{WHITE}
    Return a concatenated list of all the available environment variables, one per line;  currently:
