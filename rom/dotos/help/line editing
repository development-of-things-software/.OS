{ORANGE}=={YELLOW} Line Editing {ORANGE}=={WHITE}

{YELLOW}.SH{WHITE} uses a line editing scheme very similar to GNU Readline.  It supports the following shortcuts:

  {ORANGE}-{BLUE} Ctrl-A{WHITE}  Cursor to beginning of line
  {ORANGE}-{BLUE} Ctrl-E{WHITE}  Cursor to end of line

Arrow keys move the cursor left and right.  Pressing {BLUE}Enter{WHITE} sends the string of text to be processed by the application (usually {YELLOW}.SH{WHITE} or {YELLOW}Lua{WHITE}).
