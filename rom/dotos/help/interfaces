{ORANGE} == {YELLOW}Interfaces{ORANGE} == {WHITE}

One of {YELLOW}.OS{WHITE}'s distinguishing features in the ComputerCraft OS space is its concept of {ORANGE}interfaces{WHITE}.  This allows users to use whatever paradigm with which they feel most comfortable, and to switch between them with a reboot.

You can change the interface into which the system boots by running

  {BLUE}set interface {ORANGE}interface{WHITE}

For example:

  {BLUE}set interface {ORANGE}dotsh{WHITE}

change the system interface to {YELLOW}dotsh{WHITE}.

Which interface is displayed onscreen is managed by the System Interface Manager, {YELLOW}ifaced{ORANGE}.  This exports a simple interface over {YELLOW}.OS{WHITE}'s IPC mechanism to allow starting and stopping of interfaces at runtime, as well as switching between them, much more seamlessly than with the old system that required a reboot.  It can be controlled with the {YELLOW}iface{WHITE} command.
