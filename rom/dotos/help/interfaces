{ORANGE} == {YELLOW}Interfaces{ORANGE} == {WHITE}

One of {YELLOW}.OS{WHITE}'s distinguishing features in the ComputerCraft OS space is its concept of {ORANGE}interfaces{WHITE}.  This allows users to use whatever paradigm with which they feel most comfortable, and to switch between them with a reboot.

You can change the interface into which the system boots by running

  {BLUE}set interface {ORANGE}interface{WHITE}

For example:

  {BLUE}set interface {ORANGE}dotsh{WHITE}

change the system interface to {YELLOW}dotsh{WHITE}.

The system interface is loaded by the startup script {YELLOW}/dotos/startup/90_interface.lua{WHITE}.  This script searches the path:

  {RED}/dotos/interfaces/?/main.lua;/shared/interfaces/?/main.lua{WHITE}

for the configured interface.  If it does not find that interface, it will default to {YELLOW}dotsh{WHITE} and print a warning.
